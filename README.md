# Weather-Forecast
Developed a weather forecast application for android and web application hosted on AWS that gives all the details of the weather condition of a place at the current time, 24 hours and a week.

The project has additional features such as a weather map using ARIES, OWM API and sharing the weather on social media using Facebook SDK.

The front end and validation are done using Jquery and the APIs connectivity is established using a PHP script hosted on AWS.
